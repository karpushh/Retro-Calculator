This is an basic calculator program made with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
It can add, extract, divide and multiply decimal or integer numbers.

it is extremely error prone and source code is bad , i just got bored from it, just wanted to finish and move on

I just wanted to renew it and it went quite good.
It is retro now.
But it doesn't have that much of a input validation
